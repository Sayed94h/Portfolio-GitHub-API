# Using GitHub API to show my works

## This is an individual project

In this project I am going to search and filter what I did on GitHub and display on a web page

I will practice:

1. Fetch in JS
2. Fetch REST in JS
3. Promises
4. Classes
5. And another techniques and skills of development/ web development

Have a look at the [development strategy](./project-planning/development-strategy.md)
